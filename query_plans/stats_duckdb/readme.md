DuckDB plans:

- `2_original_with_aliases` contains the query plans generated by DuckDB for the preprocessed SQL queries of the STATS-CEB benchmark. In the preprocessed queries, all "table AS alias" statements are replaced by "alias". The preprocessed queries are in `../../benchmarks/stats-ceb/preprocessed_queries`. 

- `3_no_filters_and_projections` contains the plans from `2_original_with_aliases` with all intermediate filters and projections removed. In other words, HASHJOIN -> PROJECTION -> FILTER -> HASHJOIN is replaced by HASHJOIN -> HASHJOIN. This is only done for the first run (of 10).

These two folders are converted to an intermediate representation (IR) format using the `create_IR_plans.sh` script. This IR format can be processed by our [Rust crate](../../intermediate_to_df_plan), which executes these plans in Datafusion.

- `yannakakis` contains the 2NSA plans for all queries, also in IR format.
