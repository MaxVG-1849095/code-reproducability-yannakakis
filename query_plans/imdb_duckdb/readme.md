DuckDB plans:

- `2_original_with_aliases` contains the query plans generated by DuckDB for the preprocessed SQL queries of the join-order-benchmark. In the preprocessed queries, all "table AS alias" statements are replaced by "alias". The preprocessed queries can be found in `../../benchmarks/imdb/preprocessed_queries`. 

- `3_no_filters_and_projections` contains the plans from `2_original_with_aliases` with all intermedate filters and projections removed. In other words, HASHJOIN -> PROJECTION -> FILTER -> HASHJOIN is replaced by HASHJOIN -> HASHJOIN.



The second and third folder are converted to the IR format using the `create_IR_plans.sh` script.
